# SNHU-CS-330
 My long arduous journey through Computer Graphics and Visualization
 
## How do I approach designing software?
During the design phase, I tend to do research and sketch out a plan with bullet points on what I must accomplish. My process for this class was to take multiple photos of my objects and pick the best layout that would be aesthetically pleasing. While I had no OpenGL experience, I wrote pseudocode to help create my own template with an initialization function and render loop. This allowed me to go into the project with a game plan on where all of the pieces would go. I also decomposed the rubrics into checklists (almost like a product backlog) to ensure that I hit all of the requested parameters.
### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
As a hobbyist, I approached design from a video game developer's perspective. When planning, I chose textures that I hoped added a sense of depth and realism. For example, the traffic cone texture looks orange at first glance, however if one were to zoom in, they would see scuff marks and scratches. From a software design perspective, this was the first project where I had to design with multiple input devices in mind. 
### What design process did you follow for your project work?
Check Rubric->Research->Jot down notes/ideas->Research some more->Condense into checklist/sketch->Start coding
### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
This class hammered in the importance of planning and research. I had to get comfortable reading the documentation from the Khronus Group and the OpenGL Superbible. Both are not exactly pultizer-quality writing, but were invaluable in understanding what was going on in the OpenGL context. In future work, with different languages and frameworks, being comfortable reading and digesting documentation, should come in handy when presented with new situations.

## How do I approach developing programs?
I tend to use a lot of prototyping and testing. During these last two semesters, and during this class in particular, I really embraced using GitHub to upload all of my assignments and milestones. This enables me to experiment without fear of completely breaking my code, while allowing myself to see my progression.
### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
Since I had a basic framework written, I wrote my code in chunks. I would get the OpenGL window to run with a solid color, then focus on getting my fragment and vertex shader's in order. Then I would focus on vertices, triangles, and shapes. Once I had a basic model, I would tweak it and focus on aesthetics. This illustrates planning, breaking down a problem, building on a foundation, prototyping, and refinining.
### How did iteration factor into your development?
I went in with the old agile adage of "delivering working software frequently." If one looked at my Github page, it would show 95 commits between December and February 27th. Once I accomplished a goal, such as rendering a primative, I would push the iteration to Github. The larger milestones throughout the course served as sprint goals. For example, week 3 involved making a complex object, week 4 added camera controls, week 5 added texture and week 6 added lighting. Week 7 served as a the project deadline where each milestone was combined into the final deliverable.
### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
My approach to developing code evolved from throwing everything in the main function, to utilizing header files, separate cpp files and functions to create modular, reusable code. For example, in my TIE Fighter object, I created a function called "drawTIEFighter()" that draws the fighter consisting of 29 primitives. This function can be reused to generate more than one model.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
The study of computer science can help me create functional, high-performing applications with a focus on user experience. The ability to work through a program and break it down into its smallest components can make solving larger problems easier.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Honestly, CS-330 has really improved my confidence at tackling hard to grasp concepts. Learning OpenGL is no joke.
### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
I work in logistics and we are undergoing a transition to newer programs. In the future, I can see them releasing software that visualizes the exact dimensions of each box or item on a pallet of each trailer. I can see WebGL being utilized in such an endeavour, and if I receive my degree by that time, I would love to put my OpenGL skill to good use.
